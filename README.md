# Book Store App

This is a second-hand book selling application built with Flask, MySQL (via SQLAlchemy), HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. Users can register, log in, browse available books, add books to their cart, view book details, and simulate transactions (buy or rent books). The project includes features like:

- **User Registration & Login:** Secure sign-up and login functionality using password hashing (Flask-Bcrypt).
- **Book Listing:** Responsive grid layout using Bootstrap cards to showcase available books.
- **Book Details:** Detailed view with book information and customer reviews.
- **Cart System:** Add books to a cart and view/update items with a checkout process.
- **Dummy Transaction:** A simulated payment form to complete a purchase.
- **Database Management:** SQLAlchemy-powered models for Users, Books, Reviews, Discounts, Transactions, and CartItems, backed by MySQL.
